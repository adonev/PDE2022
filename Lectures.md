### 1 (Aug 1st) [Review of basics of ODEs, Linear Algebra, and Multivariable Calculus](Lectures/Lecture_PreReview.pdf)

We will start (before Labor Day) with a review of some material from ODE, Linear Algebra, and multivariable calculus (as time permits) as this will be used in the class.

Reading: Appendix B.1 and B.2 in Olver, Appendix A.1-A.3 in Strauss.

We will only review a small part of LA, and come back to the rest when we need it in the second half of the course.

## Basics of PDEs

We will take some time to go through what is condensed in section 1.1 in Strauss, and contained in Chapter 1 of Olver.

### 2 (Aug 6th) [Introduction to PDEs](Lectures/Lecture_PDEIntro.pdf)

We will go through some notations and examples of PDEs and some sample solutions.
