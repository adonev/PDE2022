### 1 (Aug 1st) [Review of ODEs and Linear Algebra](Lectures/Lecture_PreReview.pdf)

We will start (before Labor Day) with a review of some material from ODE and Linear Algebra, as this will be used in the class.

Reading: Appendix B.1 and B.2 in Olver.

We will only do the first part of LA review, and come back to the rest when we need it in the second half of the course.

## Basics of PDEs

We will take some time to go through what is condensed in section 1.1 in Strauss, and contained in Chapter 1 of Olver.

### 2 (Aug 6th) [Introduction to PDEs](Lectures/Lecture_PDEIntro.pdf)

We will go through some notations and examples of PDEs and some sample solutions.
