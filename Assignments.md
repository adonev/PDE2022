title: Assignments for PDE at NYU
layout: default
---

Homeworks will be submitted and graded via [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com). No late homework is accepted without **prior** approval from the instructor, except for unforseen medical reasons with documentation.

## Collaboration policy

[NYU academic integrity policies](http://www.nyu.edu/about/policies-guidelines-compliance/policies-and-guidelines/academic-integrity-for-students-at-nyu.html) will be strictly enforced for homework assignments.
* It is OK to discuss with other students the solution strategy, and compare results. You must however **explicitly acknowledge any help that you receive from any source**.
* Each student must complete the derivation/solution and steps and write the solutions independently, ensuring that they understand and can reproduce the solution if called on. Copying of any portion of someone else's solution or allowing others to copy your solution is considered cheating.

## Homework assignments

Submit the solution on Gradescope.

### 1. [Introduction to PDEs](Assignments/Homework1.pdf)

This homework covers the basics of PDEs, and doesn't require much more than basic calculus to complete, so you should start working on it as soon as classes begin.
