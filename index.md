# Partial Differential Equations (MATH-UA.0263-001) Fall 2022

All materials related to this course, including lecture notes, homeworks, schedule, etc., will be posted here. Brightspace will be used for communication and grading.

The class content will be similar to that of my [Spring 2020 class](https://cims.nyu.edu/~donev/Teaching/PDE/), so consult those websites for an example of what to expect in terms of content.

## Logistics

Class will be in person in Warren Weaver Hall, room 101, Tuesdays and Thursdays, 9:30am - 10:45pm, starting August 1st 2022.

We will use [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com) for submitting and grading of homeworks and exams.

I have asked NYU ITS to record my lectures via panopto and post them on Brightspace.

## Instruction

### Instructor
Aleksandar Donev, ad139. Office hours Tuesdays 2-4pm EST starting 8/6/2022, unless communicated otherwise. Feel free to request an appointment by email.
### Teaching Assistant
TBD.
### Grader
TBD, via Gradescope.

## Topics

Many natural phenomena have been successfully formulated as partial differential equations: common applications include Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Economics and population dynamics. This course will be primarily focused on the theory of linear partial differential equations such as the heat equation, the wave equation and the Laplace equation, including separation of variables, Fourier series and transforms, Laplace transforms, and Green's functions. Some discussion of non-linear conservation laws and the theory of shock waves will be given as time permits. The use of computers to solve PDEs numerically (using Maple or Matlab) will also be briefly covered.

## Textbooks

My lecture notes will not follow any specific textbook, however, I will refer to and students will use two textbooks:

### Primary 
Walter Strauss, [Partial Differential Equations: An Introduction](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Partial+Differential+Equations%3A+An+Introduction%2C+2nd+Edition-p-9780470473184), John Wiley & Sons, second edition, ISBN-13: 978-0470054567. This book has been used a number of times in previous semesters so there should be plenty of used copies. This book is focused and widely used, but it is a bit terse and may not provide enough explanations.

### Secondary
This secondary book is very nice and most complete textbook that is also freely available to you in PDF format is Peter J. Olver, Introduction to Partial Differential Equations, [available on Springer Link](http://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-02099-0). I strongly recommend using this textbook to get some additional perspective and more discussion and examples, especially when the primary source is not enough for you.

## Grading

The grade will be based on 25% Homework, 25% Midterm, 50% Final.

[Academic integrity policies](http://www.nyu.edu/about/policies-guidelines-compliance/policies-and-guidelines/academic-integrity-for-students-at-nyu.html) will be strictly enforced for homework assignments. Copying homework problems from someone else is a serious violation that can lead to expulsion from your program.

## Inclusiveness

As an instructor, I will strive to create a safe, respectful, and inclusive environment for all students regardless of their identity. I recognize and value diversity inside and outside of the classroom, and recognize that each student has a unique contribution to make and brings with them different strengths and weaknesses. I welcome your ideas for how to promote a better understanding and deeper learning in this class as a community. Please feel free to ask questions, to participate in discussions, and to suggest new approaches to the class content. Please also feel welcome to raise any issue you may have in class or outside of class, including reporting incidents of bias or discrimination, whether intentional or unintentional, either to me, to your advisor(s)/mentor(s), or by using the [NYU Bias Response Line](https://www.nyu.edu/about/policies-guidelines-compliance/equal-opportunity/bias-response.html).
